I created a Python program that automates buys&sells of stocks according to user-inputted parameters for preferred
stocks and fluctuation multiple value using Korea Investment & Securitiesâ€™ open-API for stock data.
It was utilized the Volatility breakout strategy to target the purchase price, based on the fluctuation value from the
previous day, executing when the current price exceeds designated fluctuation value.
